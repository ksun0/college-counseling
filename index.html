                <h2 class="major">Background</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China with a CS and Economics dual degree. After
                    getting a CS master's degree in the US,
                    I started a career in the technology industry, and worked in companies such as Cisco, Amazon, and a
                    few startups. I moved to Lexington, MA,
                    when my kids attended middle schools there. Even though both my kids went to private high schools,
                    I am pretty familiar with students' growth path and available resources in public schools as well.
                </p>

                <p>I have two boys. My older one is the 2013 Mathcounts national champion. He graduated from Phillips
                    Exeter Academy in 2017,
                    and is one of the few high school students who went to three US Olympiad Camps (Math, Physics and
                    USACO)。
                    He also did math and physics research outside of school, which won awards like Siemens Competition
                    and Regeneron Science Talent Search finalist.
                    He is one of the few students who is heavily involved in both STEM competitions and research. He
                    graduated from Harvard in 2021 with a math
                    bachelor and CS master double degree. My younger one is passionate about CS and Entrepreneurship
                    (founder of HackNEHS). He figured this out after many other unsuccessful attempts,
                    such as various math and science competitions. These experience was very frustrating, but was an
                    unavoidable journey of self-exploration.
                    It is good he finally found his true passion. He graduated from Phillips Andover in 2018, and
                    graduated from UPenn in 2022 with double degress from Engineering College and Wharton Business
                    School(M&T program),
                    and a master degree in data stats.</p>

                <p>During those years overseeing my two boys and other students, I accumulated a rich inventory of
                    resources in high school competitions (math, physics,
                    chemistry, biology, cs, writing, economics) and research (outside school and over the summer), as
                    well as high quality program choices in
                    business and entrepreneurship. In recent years, I also advised a few students interested in writing,
                    debate and politics. Every student is unique,
                    there is no way to clone any other person's activities. Blindly copying the growth path of other
                    high achievers will only lead to more
                    nervousness and frustration. Parents should encourage their kids to keep exploring one's own
                    interests and potential, have a realistic
                    realization of your capability and strength, and create a unique brand which belongs to yourself.
                    Gradually learn the skills of critical
                    thinking and decision making. Even though the planning is done to prepare and get ready for college
                    applications, the ultimate goal is to
                    train students into an independent, confident and impactful self. The two goals do not conflict.</p>

                <p>I do not pick on student grades, but I pick on student attitude -- I am eager to work with
                    self-disciplined
                    students and reasonable/realistic parents. I am confident I can help students challenge themselves
                    as long as we both work together with
                    trust and strategies. </p>

            <!-- Work -->
            <article id="work">
                <h2 class="major">High School Service</h2>
                <p>I want to work with self-disciplined and motivated high school students to reach their personal
                    goals, regardless their academic level.
                    I help students with following items:<br /><br />
                    1. curriculum planning for the whole high school years, including course selection per semester or
                    per term，and standard tests (AP, SAT, ACT, etc).
                    For students who need help for school work, I have partner tutors in all subjects.<br />
                    2. based on student interest and strength, recommend a few selective clubs or extracurricular
                    activities, adjust direction accordingly as we go.<br />
                    3. For advanced students, recommend out-of-school academic resources such as competition programs or
                    research mentors,
                    and prepare students with math, science, writing, research, entrepreneur, or business competitions.
                    <br />
                    4. recommend summer programs, help with application essay and communication with research
                    mentors<br />
                    5. pick a personal project to work on for longer term, which fits the student skill set while having
                    a community impact.
                    This is a critical item that adds strength to college application。<br />
                    6. work with student on an execution plan, sometimes leverage my personal connections. When facing
                    obstacles, discuss with students how to make a choice,
                    evaluate pros and cons, help students develop critical thinking and independent problem solving
                    skill sets.
                    This service item is something I am very proud of. A few students in the past had said they
                    benefited greatly while working
                    with me.
                </p>

                <p>The following two packages are available：<br />

                    1. Advisor Role <br />
                    Meet with student once a month, help parents to provide guidance to student. Identify areas to
                    improve from my own observations. Does not include item 6 above。<br />
                    Parents who fit this package: know their kid well and have time to guide their kid, but are not
                    familiar with resources that they can make use of;
                    need help crafting possible growth journeys。<br />
                    Students who fit this pacakge：mature, good time management, self-motivated, can execute well based
                    on instructions.</p>
                <p>2. Parent Proxy <br />
                    Guide students with all of their academics and activities, just like my own kid, try to explore
                    their best potentials.
                    Meet with students as frequently as once per week while school is in session. <br />


                    Parents who fit this package：do not have time to guide their kids or have language barriers.<br />
                    Students who fit this pacakge：need someone to monitor their academics closely and help with
                    executions.</p>

                <h2 class="major">College Application</h2>
                <p>My package includes the following items: <br /><br />
                    1. Recommend a couple research oriented summer programs after 11th grade, try to correlate the
                    program with student interest and college major.
                    Help with application materials and application essays.<br />
                    2. Recommend a list of colleges to apply based on students interests and strength. Around 15
                    schools, vary in difficulties.<br />
                    3 Make a school visiting plan, and application milestones for the summer. <br />
                    4. Review Common App applications, including 5 awards, 10 activities, essays, optional uploads,
                    showing a clear persona in the overall portfolio
                    (UC schools, MIT, Georgetown don't use Common App, Oxford/Cambridge has its own system too.
                    They are included if students choose to apply.) <br />
                    5. Brainstorming essays topics for all schools, maximized topic re-use <br />
                    6. Assigned assay tutor will be responsible for polishing up to 10 school essays, UC system counts
                    as one. (based on past experience,
                    students can easily recycle essays for rest of schools beyond the 10th one). Essay is revised many
                    times, until the tutor,
                    student and me are all happy. Important essays will be reviewed by more than one tutor.<br />
                    7. Advise which teacher to use for recommendation letters and strategies to ask for a quality
                    letter.<br />
                    8. Review parent and student questionnaires which influence recommendation letters<br />
                    9. Answer all questions from students and parents during the application cycle. Turn around time is
                    usually less than 24 hours. <br />
                    10. Advise how to pick optional materials, such as resume, video upload, research abstract,
                    etc.<br />
                    11. Help students to talk to other students who are already in college to get insider information
                    for a particular school.<br />
                    12. Prepare for interview content and rehearsal interview <br />
                    13. Advise off waiting list actions</p>

                <p>My college advising has the following strength:<br />
                    1. I have a very strong essay tutor team. These experienced tutors are selected over the past few
                    years who can give concret suggestions and detailed instructions that students can follow.
                    Every year I have students who came to me seeking essay help because they couldn't continue with
                    their previous essay tutor. <br />
                    2. I spent a lot time with studnts on how to ask for recommendation letters. Most college advisors
                    let students do this on their own. I have a set of strategies to
                    help students influence the content of their teacher recommendation letters, which directely
                    contribute to better chance of admission. The key is to prepare early。</p>
